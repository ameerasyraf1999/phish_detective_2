# Penetration Test Report: SMS Phish Detective (Updated)

**Date:** May 29, 2025

## 1. Introduction
This updated report documents the results of a new penetration test and static security analysis performed on the SMS Phish Detective Flutter application, including the latest code obfuscation and dependency status.

---

## 2. Testing Methodology
- **Static Code Analysis:** Automated/manual review of Dart, C++, Swift, and configuration files for vulnerabilities, secrets, and insecure patterns.
- **Dependency Audit:** Checked for outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
- **API Security Review:** Evaluated the integration and security of the phishing detection API.
- **Data Storage Review:** Assessed local database handling for sensitive data exposure.
- **Reverse Engineering:** APK was disassembled and checked for obfuscation, manifest, permissions, and smali code.

## 3. Findings (May 29, 2025)

### 3.1 Hardcoded Secrets & Sensitive Data
- **Result:** No hardcoded passwords, API keys, or tokens found in the code or APK.
- **Risk:** Low

### 3.2 Dependency Security
- **Result:**
  - Some dependencies remain outdated. Outdated dependencies may expose the project to known vulnerabilities.
- **Recommendation:** Run `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions` regularly.
- **Risk:** Medium

### 3.3 API Integration Security
- **Result:**
  - API uses HTTPS (Heroku enforced).
  - No authentication or rate limiting is implemented on the backend API.
- **Recommendation:** Add authentication and rate limiting to the API for production use.
- **Risk:** Medium

### 3.4 Local Data Storage Security
- **Result:**
  - SMS logs are stored locally using SQLite (`sqflite`).
  - No sensitive credentials are stored.
  - No encryption is applied to the local database.
- **Recommendation:** Consider encrypting the local database if storing sensitive data in the future.
- **Risk:** Low

### 3.5 Permissions & Manifest Review
- **Result:**
  - The app requests only necessary permissions for SMS monitoring.
  - No dangerous or excessive permissions beyond the app's purpose.
  - `allowBackup` attribute is not found (good).
- **Risk:** Low

### 3.6 Exported Components
- **Result:**
  - Main activity and SMS receiver are exported as required, with proper permission protection.
- **Risk:** Low

### 3.7 Code Obfuscation & Reverse Engineering Risk
- **Result:**
  - Code obfuscation (ProGuard/R8) is now enabled for release builds.
  - Smali code is now obfuscated, making reverse engineering more difficult.
  - No anti-tamper, anti-debug, or root detection logic found.
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding runtime protections for higher security needs.
- **Risk:** Low/Medium

### 3.8 Insecure Code Patterns
- **Result:** No use of WebView, JavaScript, or insecure network protocols found. No evidence of insecure cryptography, hardcoded credentials, or sensitive data storage in code. No suspicious use of system commands, reflection, or dynamic code loading.
- **Risk:** Low

## 4. Summary Table (Updated)

| Category                | Issue Found? | Risk Level | Recommendation                        |
|------------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded Secrets      | No           | Low        | None                                  |
| Outdated Dependencies  | Yes          | Medium     | Upgrade dependencies                  |
| API Auth/Rate Limiting | No           | Medium     | Add auth & rate limiting              |
| Local DB Encryption    | No           | Low        | Consider if storing sensitive data    |
| Permissions Review     | No           | Low        | None                                  |
| Exported Components    | No           | Low        | None                                  |
| Code Obfuscation Risk  | Addressed    | Low/Medium | Obfuscation enabled                   |
| Insecure Code Patterns | No           | Low        | None                                  |

## 5. Recommendations (Updated)
- **Update all dependencies** to the latest secure versions.
- **Implement authentication and rate limiting** on the phishing detection API before production deployment.
- **Encrypt local database** if sensitive data storage is planned.
- **Continue code obfuscation** (ProGuard/R8) for production APKs.
- **Consider runtime protections** (anti-tamper, anti-debug, root detection) for higher security needs.

---

## 6. Conclusion (Updated)
The SMS Phish Detective app demonstrates good security hygiene in its codebase and UI. Code obfuscation is now enabled, reducing reverse engineering risk. The main remaining risks are outdated dependencies and lack of authentication/rate limiting on the backend API. Addressing these will further strengthen the application's security posture.
